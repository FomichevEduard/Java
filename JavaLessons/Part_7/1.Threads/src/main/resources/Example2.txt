«Order book» task

Before you start

Please follow these instructions super accurately.

 

Develop the solution in Java (you can use Maven as a build tool if you want)
The core of the solution should be written without any add-ons to the core of the programming language. Use only the defined language standard (e.g. you can use all features that you find in a standard JDK). This means that you can use external libraries, but your program should still produce the required output after removing those parts. For example, if you would decide to use a logging library then your program would still work correctly after removing all parts that use the logging library. You can also use JUnit.
Optimize for quality of development and execution speed.
-          In general execution time on PC with HDD should be around 6 seconds.

-          Be ready to explain and protect all performance optimizations (if there will be any).

Deliver your result in the best professional quality you can produce. Polish your solution. Make a master piece out of it.  It is part of this task to compare what different people consider to be a professional quality solution.
